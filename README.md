# automate
Various small automation tasks for a linux workstation primarily using systemd and docker

## Tasks
- **update-docker-images**: Regular, automated updates for a configurable list of docker images 

## Warning
I try to keep task small, simple and for one purpose only. That does not mean that nothing
can go wrong. Use them at our own risk and only if you understand what they are doing.
Do not execute any install script from the internet, particularly not as root, before you 
checked it line by line!

## Installation
You can install the tasks individually by running
```bash
./install.sh
```
within its folder. The scripts usually require root privileges.
