# automate
Various small automation tasks for a linux workstation primarily using systemd and docker

## Warning
I try to keep task small, simple and for one purpose only. That does not mean that nothing
can go wrong. Use them at our own risk and only if you understand what they are doing.
Do not execute any install script with sudo before you checked it line by line!

## Tasks
- **update-docker-images**: Regular, automated updates for a configurable list of docker images
